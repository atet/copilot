# Artificial Intelligence Copilot to Help You Code

Setup and some basic examples to get you started in <u><b>less than 10 minutes</b></u>; *programming will never be the same for you after this!*

In this short tutorial, you will:
- Sign up for Google Gemini AI access
- Setup Visual Studio Code (a.k.a. VSCode)
- Download and setup the AI copilot with Gemini in VSCode
- Perform five quick examples to demonstrate the power of this technology

Note that I developed this tutorial on Windows 10, Windows 11 and MacOS should be very similar.

## Google Gemini Access

You have to get programmatic (i.e., API) access to use Google Gemini outside of their web-based, chat offering.

1. Go to Google AI Studio and sign in with your Google account at https://aistudio.google.com/welcome
2. After signing in, click on "Get API key"
3. It may take up to 30 seonds to generate an API key, copy the key down for a later step, **do not share your API key**

## Visual Studio Code Setup

You can use VSCode without installing it by just downloading the "portable" `*.zip` version.

4. Download the `*.zip` version here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
5. Extract the file
6. Within the extracted directory, add a new folder named "`data`"
7. Click on `Code.exe` to start up VSCode
8. Once VSCode is running, click on the Extensions tab in the left side menu (or use keyboard shortcut `CTRL+SHIFT+X`)

## AI Copilot Extension Setup

We will use the Continue extension to leverage Google Gemini to help us code within VSCode.

9. Search for "Conitue" in the Extensions search bar
10. Install the Continue extension from continue.dev
11. Once it's done installing, click on the Continue icon in the left side menu
12. Click on "Select Model" and then "Add Chat Model"
13. This will open a window that will allow you to select:
   - "Provider: Google Gemini API"
   - "Model: Gemini 2 Flash"
   - "API key: `<ENTER YOUR API KEY FROM STEP #3>`"
14. Click on Connect and now you can ask questions like, "*Hi Gemini, what is my API usage rate limit?*"
